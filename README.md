# 🔧 MrNewbPawn

Hey everyone,

This script is one of my oldest projects. Despite never being actively maintained, it's still out there in use — and I truly appreciate that. As a small thank-you, I’m releasing a refreshed version to bring it in line with modern server frameworks and provide better customization.

## 🛠️ What’s New

- **🔌 Community Bridge Integration**  
  The script has been migrated to use [`community_bridge`](https://github.com/The-Order-Of-The-Sacred-Framework/community_bridge), enabling compatibility with **QBCore**, **QBox**, and modern versions of **ESX**. This improves integration and support across current frameworks.

- **🏪 Multiple Shop Support**  
  Easily set up multiple pawn shops across your map, each with customizable blips to match your server’s layout or roleplay flavor.

- **⏰ Optional Time-Based Availability**  
  Time-based open and close functionality is still available, but can now be toggled off via the config.

- **🔥 Item Smelting**  
  A new feature in the config allows certain items to be smelted down, at specified locations adding more gameplay depth.

- **🗺️ Blip Control**  
  All blips are optional — keep your map clean or fully marked, entirely your choice.

## 📦 Dependencies

This script requires the following:

- [`community_bridge`](https://github.com/The-Order-Of-The-Sacred-Framework/community_bridge)  
- [`ox_lib`](https://github.com/overextended/ox_lib)

Make sure these are installed and set up correctly for full functionality.

## 💬 Notes & Feedback

- This isn’t a full rewrite — just a lightweight upgrade to improve compatibility and add features.
- Not quite a "v2", but a solid refresh for those still using or discovering the script.

I'm open to feedback and feature requests — feel free to share any ideas. Just wanted to give something simple, effective, and best of all — **free** — back to the community.

Thanks for the continued support!
